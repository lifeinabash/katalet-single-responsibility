A Single Responsibility micro workshop

This is an attempt to design a curriculum for developers of all abilities to level up quickly via deliberate real world experience.

# How to use the curriculum

Simply read the presentation or doc file to learn about the issue.

Checkout the runnable code under src/{fav-language} that violates the learned pattern.

Have fun fixing it. :)

Over and over.... and over again. Explore new options, do it "wrong," do it "right."
